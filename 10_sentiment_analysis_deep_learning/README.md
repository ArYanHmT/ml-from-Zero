💬 Sentiment Analysis with Neural Network

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using a Neural Network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

🎯 Goal

Predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.

📊 Dataset

IMDB movie reviews dataset

Loaded directly from TensorFlow

🧠 Model Architecture

Embedding layer (10000 words, 32 dimensions)

Dense hidden layer (ReLU activation)

Output layer (Sigmoid activation)

⚙️ Process

Load dataset

Pad sequences to fixed length

Build neural network

Train the model

Evaluate accuracy

📈 Result

The model typically achieves around 85% accuracy on test data.

🛠 Libraries
