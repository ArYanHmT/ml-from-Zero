# 🧠 ML From Zero

Welcome to ML From Zero — a personal journey to build and understand machine learning algorithms from scratch, without relying on existing ML libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository is a collection of small projects and implementations created as part of my learning process in Machine Learning.  
Each folder focuses on a specific topic or algorithm — starting from basic linear models to more advanced deep learning concepts — all implemented step by step in pure Python and NumPy.

---

## 📚 Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms by implementing them manually  
- Strengthen understanding of mathematical foundations behind ML  
- Build a strong base for using advanced frameworks later  
- Create educational resources to help others learn ML from zero  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered (ongoing)
- Linear Regression (from scratch)  
- Logistic Regression  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Decision Trees  
- Basic Neural Networks  
- Gradient Descent & Optimization  
- Data Preprocessing Techniques  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python 3
