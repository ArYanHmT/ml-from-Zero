# 06 - Customer Segmentation using KMeans 👥

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning.

## 🎯 Project Goal
Group customers based on similarities in their age and spending behavior without using labels.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- Clustering with KMeans
- How models find patterns without labels
- Visualizing clusters using matplotlib

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Create a dataset of customers (Age & Spending)
2. Apply KMeans clustering
3. Automatically group similar customers
4. Visualize clusters on a scatter plot

## 📊 Result
The model groups customers into clusters based on their similarity in spending behavior.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Use real customer datasets
- Try different numbers of clusters
- Apply 3D clustering
